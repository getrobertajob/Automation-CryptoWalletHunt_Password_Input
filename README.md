# Automation-CryptoWalletHunt_Password_Input  

Script to automate inputting passwords into Etrnl Crypto Wallet addon from a list of possible seed phrase words.  

-Basically for Eternl is a brand of Crypto Wallets on the Cardano blockchain.  
-The recovery option is to input a combination of 24 words that were randomly generated during wallet creation.  
-Both the correct words and the order of words must match.  
-A NFT project held a scavenger hunt to find all the 24 words for the seed phrase.  
-I found all words but not the correct order.  
-So I created a document that contained every possible combination using all 24 words.  
-Script inputs the words in the order from each page of the document & attemts to use the wallet recovery.
