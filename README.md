# Automation-CryptoWalletHunt_Password_Input
Script used to automate inputting passwords into Etrnl Crypto Wallet addon from a list of possible seed phrase words.
-Basically for Eternl is a brand of Crypto Wallets on the Cardano blockchain.
-The recovery option if password is unknown is to input a combination of 24 words that were randomly generated during original wallet creation.
-Both the correct words and the order of words must match.
-A NFT project held a scavenger hunt to find all the 24 words for the seed phrase.
-I found all words but not the correct order.
-So I created a document that contained every possible combination using all 24 words.
-This AutoHotKey script automated inputting the words in the order from each page of the document and attemts to use the wallet recovery.
